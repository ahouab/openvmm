We strongly suggest asking for feedback before you begin working on a new feature/functionality/enhancement/etc. so that we can provide feedback and discuss how we can collaborate on this and support you.

To get this feedback, depending on your preference, you can either reach out to us on [Zulip](https://openvmm.zulipchat.com) and then start drafting a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/microsoft/openvmm/issues/new?template=Blank+issue) after getting some preliminary feedback on Zulip, or you can open a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/microsoft/openvmm/issues/new?template=Blank+issue)  to get preliminary feedback on GitHub and then reach out to us on [Zulip](https://openvmm.zulipchat.com) to get some more synchronous support. We normally use Zulip for more informal conversations and GitHub Issues for more formal, auditable, public discussion and progress tracking, so feel free to use both in either order based on your preference.

After you get feedback from us get started! OpenVMM uses the “fork-and-pull” development model. See [GitHub forks](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks) for more information on forks. Please follow these steps if you want to merge your changes to OpenVMM:
1.	[Fork](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks/fork-a-repo#forking-a-repository) the OpenVMM repo.
2.	Create a branch for your contribution and develop your code.
3.	Create a PR against the main branch of the OpenVMM repository [from your fork](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork).
4.	Iterate on your PR based on feedback as needed.
5.	Once the PR is approved, it will be integrated!
