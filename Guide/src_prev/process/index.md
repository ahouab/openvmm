# Developing in OpenVMM

One of our major goals with OpenVMM is to provide high quality documentation,
organization, testing, and a consistent set of coding conventions.

This section of the guide goes more in depth about the automated tooling and
manual guidelines that work in-tandem to help us execute on this goal.
