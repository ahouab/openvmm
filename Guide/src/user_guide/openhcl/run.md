# Running OpenHCL

This chapter provides a high-level overview of different ways to launch and
interact with OpenHCL.

## Obtaining a copy of OpenHCL

To get started, ensure you have a copy of an OpenHCL IGVM firmware image, via
one of the following options:

### Building OpenHCL Locally

Follow the instructions on: [Building OpenHCL](../../dev_guide/getting_started/build_openhcl.md).

If you would prefer to try OpenHCL without building it from scratch, you can
download pre-built copies of OpenHCL IGVM files from
[OpenVMM CI](https://github.com/microsoft/openvmm/actions/workflows/openvmm-ci.yaml).

Simply select a successful pipeline run (should have a Green checkbox), and
scroll down to select an appropriate `*-openhcl-igvm` artifact for your
particular architecture and operating system.
