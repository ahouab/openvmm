# Running OpenVMM

This chapter provides a high-level overview of different ways to launch and
interact with OpenVMM.

* * *

To get started, ensure you have a copy of the OpenVMM binary, via one of the
following options:

## Building OpenVMM

Please refer to the page [Building OpenVMM](../../dev_guide/getting_started/build_openvmm.md)

## Pre-Built Binaries

If you would prefer to try OpenVMM without building it from scratch, you can
download pre-built copies of the binary from
[OpenVMM CI](https://github.com/microsoft/openvmm/actions/workflows/openvmm-ci.yaml).

Simply select a successful pipeline run (should have a Green checkbox), and
scroll down to select an appropriate `*-openvmm` artifact for your particular
architecture and operating system.
